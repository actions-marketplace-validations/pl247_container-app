# Sample Container App

The purpose of this simple app is to demonstrate the ability to automatically build a container image and publish it to the github container registry (ghcr.io) upon code change.

Then the newly updated container can be immediately consumed in Intersight Kubernetes Service (IKS).

## To Do

Need to create versioning strategy so the build and publish only happens on major release and not each code update.
